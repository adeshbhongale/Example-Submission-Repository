# FullStack_Part-0

This project is a simple notes web application for learning the basics of web development, including:

- **HTML**: Structure of web pages (see `home.html`)
- **CSS**: Styling web pages (see `main.css`)
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic behavior and DOM manipulation (see `main.js`)
- **AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)**: Loading data from a JSON file (`data.json`) without reloading the page
- **Form Handling**: Adding new notes via a form
- **Local Data Management**: Displaying and updating notes on the page

## What you can learn from this project

- How to build a basic web page with HTML and CSS
- How to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle user input
- How to fetch and display data from a JSON file using AJAX
- How to handle form submissions in JavaScript
- The difference between frontend-only and fullstack (backend + frontend) applications
- Why a backend is needed to save data permanently on the server

## Limitations
- **No backend**: Notes are not saved to the server or `data.json` after a page reload. To persist data, you need a backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) or use browser storage (like `localStorage`).
- **No authentication**: Anyone can add notes if the page is open.

## How to run
1. Open `home.html` in your browser to use the app.
2. Edit `main.js` and `main.css` to experiment and learn.

## Next steps
- Add a backend to save notes permanently
- Use `localStorage` to keep notes between reloads (frontend only)
- Add more features: delete notes, edit notes, etc.

Happy learning!
