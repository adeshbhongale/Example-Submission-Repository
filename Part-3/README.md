### Tech Stack and Deployment

- **Node.js** and **Express** are used to build the backend server.
- **MongoDB Atlas** is used as the cloud database solution.
- The application is deployed on **Render**, which handles hosting and deployment automation.

To deploy a similar backend:
1. Set up your Node.js and Express application.
2. Connect your app to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
3. Push your code to a Git repository.
4. Connect the repository to Render and configure environment variables as needed.
5. Deploy and monitor your application via the Render dashboard.
